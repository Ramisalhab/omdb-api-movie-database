# omdb-api-movie-database
This project leverages the OMDB API to fetch detailed information about movies and TV series, then stores that data in a MongoDB database. It demonstrates how to interact with REST APIs, structure and store JSON data in NoSQL databases, and perform queries to extract insights.
